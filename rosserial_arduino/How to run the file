The Arduino File inside ino directory
The Python Scripts inside scripts directory
The Launch file inside launch directory

how to work:
1. Upload the arduino programs into different arduino (in this case use 2 arduino)
2. Edit the .launch file to configure the Serial port of the arduino (ttyACM* or ttyUSB*)
3. go to catkin_ws, and run catkin_make commands
4. run file by:
     roslaunch practice_launch test_launch.launch

the file will generate new topic /random_number and /random_number1, you can check the random value from each topic by using rostopic echo <topic>.
from the py file itself will show the random number from /random_number topic.
